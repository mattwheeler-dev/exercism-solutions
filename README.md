# Exercism Exercises

<p>
  I have found Exercism to be an excellent place for developers to learn and practice their skills.
  The site has a very simple and straight-forward approach, and plenty of resources if you need help.
<br />
  Folders for different languages / skills.
  File names are the same as the exercises.
<br />
  Trimmed the exports and the commented sections from Exercism.
<br />
  I recommend checking the site out <a href="https://exercism.org/dashboard" target="_blank">{ here }</a> if you haven't already.
